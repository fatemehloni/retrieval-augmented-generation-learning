# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Learning Notes and Experiments

This repository documents my learning process and hands-on experiments
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, inspired by the
Coursera course "Project: Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain".

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a solid conceptual understanding of RAG
- Experiment with core components such as document ingestion, embeddings, retrieval, and generation
- Document design decisions, trade-offs, and evaluation insights

This repository is intended as a learning and research-oriented portfolio
rather than a production-ready system.

## Structure
- `notes/` — Conceptual explanations and design insights
- `notebooks/` — Practical experiments and prototypes
- `src/` — Reusable code components
- `references/` — Learning resources and external references
