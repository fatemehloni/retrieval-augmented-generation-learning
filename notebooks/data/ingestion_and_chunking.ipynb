## Ingestion and Chunking: Learning Notes

In this notebook, I explored the ingestion and chunking stages of a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain.

The experiment started by loading a plain text document and applying
different chunking configurations to observe how document length and
chunk size affect the resulting chunks. Initially, I noticed that
different chunking settings appeared to produce similar outputs.
After further investigation, I realized that this was due to the
document being shorter than the defined chunk sizes, which resulted
in a single chunk regardless of configuration.

By extending the document length, meaningful differences between
chunking strategies became visible. Smaller chunk sizes produced a
larger number of shorter chunks, while larger chunk sizes resulted
in fewer but longer chunks. Inspecting chunk lengths and content
helped clarify how chunk boundaries influence the granularity of
retrieved information.

Through this process, I learned that chunking behaviour is highly
dependent on the relationship between document length and chunk size.
I also gained a clearer understanding of why overly large chunks can
reduce retrieval precision, while smaller chunks tend to preserve
more focused and specific information.

This experiment reinforced the importance of validating assumptions
through direct observation rather than relying solely on expected
behavior.
